# simon-says-game
I created this Simon Says game using the skills I learned from the Apna College Sigma Batch course. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structuring the game layout.
CSS: Styling the game interface.
JavaScript: Implementing the game logic and interactivity.

How to Play:
Watch the pattern of lights and sounds.
Repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
Each round adds one more step to the pattern.
See how many rounds you can complete without making a mistake!
